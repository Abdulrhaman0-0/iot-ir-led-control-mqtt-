# iot-ir-led-control-mqtt

This IoT project uses an **ESP8266** (or **ESP32**) microcontroller to monitor an **IR obstacle sensor** and control a **relay or LED** remotely via **MQTT protocol**. Built as part of the IoT workshop led by **Eng. Omar Barakat**.

## üìå Features

- IR sensor detection: CLEAR or OBSTACLE
- Control relay or LED via MQTT commands
- Local MQTT broker hosted on Raspberry Pi
- Dashboard on Android phone using IoT MQTT Panel
- Compatible with both ESP8266 and ESP32

## üß∞ Hardware Components

| Component         | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ESP8266 / ESP32  | Microcontroller board                      |
| IR Sensor         | Digital obstacle detection sensor          |
| Relay or LED      | Output controlled via MQTT                 |
| Raspberry Pi      | Hosts Mosquitto MQTT broker                |
| Jumper Wires      | Circuit connections                        |
| Breadboard        | Assembly base                              |

## üîå Circuit Connections

| Device         | ESP8266 Pin | ESP32 Pin (example) |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| IR Sensor OUT  | D5          | GPIO14               |
| Relay / LED IN | D6          | GPIO12               |

## üí¨ MQTT Topics

| Topic                      | Direction  | Description                  |
|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------|
| `/sectorb5/ABDO/led`      | Subscribe  | Receive On/Off commands      |
| `/sectorb5/ABDO/irsensor` | Publish    | Send IR sensor status        |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Behavior

1. ESP connects to Wi-Fi and to the MQTT broker on Raspberry Pi.
2. Publishes IR sensor status every second as `"CLEAR"` or `"OBSTACLE"`.
3. Listens for `"On"` / `"Off"` messages to control the relay/LED.
4. Reconnects to broker if connection is lost.

## üì± IoT MQTT Panel (Android App Setup)

App: **IoT MQTT Panel** ‚Äì free from Google Play

### Widgets Added:

| Widget Type   | Topic                      | Function                      |
|---------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Switch        | `/sectorb5/ABDO/led`       | Toggle relay / LED            |
| LED Indicator | `/sectorb5/ABDO/irsensor`  | Green for "CLEAR", Red for "OBSTACLE" |
| Text Log      | `/sectorb5/ABDO/irsensor`  | Shows status history & debug  |

### Connection:

- Broker IP: your Raspberry Pi IP (e.g. `10.252.0.156`)
- Port: `1883`

## üîß Raspberry Pi as MQTT Broker (Mosquitto Setup)

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Configuration for LAN Access

Create a config file to allow MQTT clients on the same network:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf
```

Add the following lines:

```conf
listener 1883
allow_anonymous true
```

Save and exit:
- `Ctrl + O` ‚Üí `Enter`
- `Ctrl + X`

Restart the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
```

---

### üî• If MQTT client can't connect (Error: ECONNREFUSED)

1. Make sure Mosquitto is listening to LAN:
   - Double-check config above.
2. Open port 1883 on firewall:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 1883
   sudo ufw reload
   ```
   Or, if UFW not enabled:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   sudo ufw allow 1883
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ How to Test the Broker

From any device:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h <raspberry_ip> -t test/topic
mosquitto_pub -h <raspberry_ip> -t test/topic -m "hello"
```

If you see the message arrive ‚Üí your broker is working üéâ
